# Image Hover Effect Project

This project demonstrates how to create an image that disappears when hovered over and reappears when the mouse moves away. The effect is implemented **purely with HTML and CSS**â€”no JavaScript is used.

## Features

- **CSS-only Hover Effect**: The image disappears on hover using the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class and `opacity` property.
- **Responsive Design**: The project uses basic styling to ensure the image remains centered on the screen.

## How It Works

1. The image is styled with a smooth transition effect using the `transition` property.
2. When the user hovers over the image (`:hover` pseudo-class), the `opacity` is set to `0`, making the image invisible.
3. Once the hover is removed, the `opacity` returns to `1`, bringing the image back into view.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskeleven.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
